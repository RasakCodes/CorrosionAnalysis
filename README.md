Report on Corrosion Index Analysis
</h1> 
This project aims to evaluate trends in water corrosiveness and streamflow across US water bodies from 1964 to 2016. The focus is on understanding the potential for corrosion in water distribution systems by analyzing Chloride-Sulfate Mass Ratio (CSMR) and Larson Ratio (LR), commonly used indicators. Deploying data from 84 river sites provided by the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) project, the study examines seasonal and flow-related variations in CSMR and LR, crucial for assessing corrosion potential. It also investigates the impact of changes in water composition on corrosion indices and aims to bridge the gap between treatment approaches at water facilities and corrosion indices. Using corrosion index values and streamflow data, the analysis employs Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) models to identify trends from 1992 to 2012. By understanding these trends, the study provides insights into corrosion implications for water distribution systems, aiding in better water management decisions. Overall, this data-driven approach contributes to understanding water quality and addressing corrosion-related issues in drinking water facilities.
